WHAT IS IT?
===========

An experimental Markdown workflow for writing No Starch books. Beats the hell
out of using straight LaTeX!

Note that if there are any NSP-specific page elements you need that Markdown
lacks syntax for (notes, boxes, etc), you can just insert straight LaTeX into
the .txt file and it will be perserved during the conversion.

Also note that this requires pandoc for the conversion, as well as anything you
need to build normal No Starch LaTeX books (fonts, extra TeX packages, etc.).

My goal here was to give authors a more palatable plaintext format to work
with, as well as something that could be easily converted into other formats
(HTML, ePub, whatever).


HOW DO I USE IT?
================

Just write your chapters! The make_pdf.sh script will automatically find any
files with extension .txt, convert them to LaTeX files using pandoc, and spruce
'em up a bit to be NSP-compatible. Then a PDF should pop out in your working
directory.

To make our lives easier, it would be best if you named your chapters in the
form: XX_name.txt, where XX is the chapter number. Note that Introductions to
NSP books are un-numbered, and are treated as Chapter 00.

Just take a look at the three sample chapters provided, it should give you a
decent idea.
