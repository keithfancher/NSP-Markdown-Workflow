\chapter{The Absolute Basics}

Yes, that's what we'll talk about in this chapter.

\section{Let's Look at Some Code}

Okay, here's an example in my own invented pseudo-code:

\begin{Code}
print "oh uh hello what okay"
if pie_crusts == amazing
    well_duh
else
    goto hell
\end{Code}

Shall we talk about this snippet? No? Okay! We should at least test an
inline \verb!literal value! or two, right?

Now let's talk \textbf{bulleted lists}:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  This is an item
\item
  This is another
\item
  What about this one?
\end{itemize}
Bye bye!

Actually, let's get another code block in there just in case:

\begin{Code}
print "bloop"
print "blaap"
\end{Code}

Yeah?

\begin{note}
This is a note.
\end{note}

\section{This Section Will Have a Numbered List}

Sound good? Here we go!

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item
  Some list item
\item
  Blah blah blah
\item
  Works great I guess
\end{enumerate}
Okay, good.
