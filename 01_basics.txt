# The Absolute Basics

Yes, that's what we'll talk about in this chapter.


## Let's Look at Some Code

Okay, here's an example in my own invented pseudo-code:

    print "oh uh hello what okay"
    if pie_crusts == amazing
        well_duh
    else
        goto hell

Shall we talk about this snippet? No? Okay! We should at least test an inline
`literal value` or two, right?

Now let's talk **bulleted lists**:

* This is an item
* This is another
* What about this one?

Bye bye!

Actually, let's get another code block in there just in case:

    print "bloop"
    print "blaap"

Yeah?

This is a note.
